;; ── targets that hold no Python ─────────────────────────────────────────────

;; Regression: an EXISTING target with no Python in it — a README, a docs
;; directory, a tree whose sources are all `.txt` — expanded to zero files and
;; came back `files 0 … clean` (lint) / `changed 0` (format): byte-identical to
;; the answer a clean project gives. A model that aimed `lint_code` at the wrong
;; directory was told its code was fine, with nothing read at all. Only a
;; NON-EXISTENT path was ever an error, though both docstrings promised that "a
;; target that resolves to nothing is an ERROR, not a silent `clean`".
