(ns com.blockether.vis.lang.python.ruff
  "`format_code` / `lint_code` for Python, backed by ruff (com.blockether/ruff).

   ruff runs IN-PROCESS: the Rust ruff_python_formatter / ruff_linter crates are
   linked as a cdylib and called over the FFM API. There is no `ruff` binary to
   install, no subprocess, no virtualenv, and no PATH lookup — the same code path
   works from the native image. Configuration is RUFF'S OWN discovery: for every
   source, ruff walks up from the file to the nearest `.ruff.toml` / `ruff.toml` /
   `pyproject.toml` with a `[tool.ruff]` table and honours it whole — `extend`,
   `per-file-ignores`, `target-version`, formatter options — so a run here and a
   `ruff` CLI run agree on every source it reads. With no config anywhere the
   tool still runs on ruff's defaults and SAYS SO in a `hint`.

   ONE divergence, the same one the sandbox `ruff` shim documents: the FFI is a
   one-source-one-call linter/formatter, so the WALK is ours and a config's
   `exclude` / `extend-exclude` globs are NOT applied to it — the noise
   directories in `skip-dirs` are pruned instead. `per-file-ignores` DO apply:
   ruff matches them itself against the path we hand it.

   Both handlers accept the SAME argument shapes as the Clojure pack:
   a code string, {\"code\"}, {\"path\"}, {\"paths\"}, or nothing (whole project)."
